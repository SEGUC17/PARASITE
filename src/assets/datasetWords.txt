We 0 0

the 0 0
thesis 0 0
of 0 0
selective 0 1
idea 0 0
that 0 0

our 0 0

to 0 0

of 0 0
the 0 0
compatibility 0 0
of 0 0
selective 0 1
representing 0 1
and 0 0

We 0 0
hope 0 0
to 0 0
show 0 0
three 0 0
things 0 0
First 0 0
that 0 0
the 0 0
notion 0 0
of 0 0
selective 0 1
representing 0 1
is 0 0
fully 0 0
consistent 0 0
with 0 0
the 0 0
realist 0 0
idea 0 0
of 0 0
a 0 0
world 0 1
Second 0 0
that 0 0
not 0 0
only 0 0
are 0 0
these 0 0
two 0 0
consistent 0 0
but 0 0
that 0 0
the 0 0
latter 0 0
the 0 0
realist 0 0
conception 0 0
of 0 0
a 0 0
world 0 1
provides 0 0
the 0 0
most 0 0
powerful 0 0
perspective 0 0
from 0 0
which 0 0
to 0 0
motivate 0 0

understand 0 0
the 0 0
differing 0 0
perceptual 0 0
and 0 0
cognitive 0 1
profiles 0 1
themselves 0 0
Third 0 0
that 0 0
the 0 0
genuine 0 0
and 0 0
important 0 0
sense 0 0
in 0 0
which 0 0

In 0 0

we 0 0

Part 1 0
A 1 0
simple 1 0
handle 1 0
class 1 0
Every 0 0
program 0 1
that 0 0
uses 0 0
inheritance 0 1
must 0 0
manage 0 0
memory 0 0
somehow 0 0
The 0 0
most 0 0
obvious 0 0
way 0 0
to 0 0
do 0 0
so 0 0
is 0 0
directly 0 0
but 0 0
programmers 0 0
who 0 0
create 0 0
complicated 0 0
data 0 0
structures 0 0
often 0 0
have 0 0
trouble 0 0
figuring 0 0
out 0 0
what 0 0
parts 0 0
of 0 0
those 0 0
data 0 0
structures 0 0
are 0 0
safe 0 0
to 0 0
delete 0 0
when 0 0
The 0 0
classical 0 0
method 0 0
of 0 0
dealing 0 0
with 0 0
such 0 0
complexity 0 0
is 0 0
to 0 0
hide 0 0
it 0 0
in 0 0
a 0 0
class 0 0
Such 0 0
classes 0 0
are 0 0
typically 0 0
called 0 0
handles 0 1
the 0 0
idea 0 0
is 0 0
to 0 0
attach 0 0
a 0 0
handle 0 0
object 0 0
to 0 0
another 0 0
object 0 0
that 0 0
contains 0 0
the 0 0
actual 0 0
data 0 0
The 0 0
simplest 0 0
form 0 0
of 0 0
a 0 0
handle 0 0
which 0 0
we 0 0
have 0 0
discussed 0 0
in 0 0
this 0 0
article 0 0
is 0 0
one 0 0
in 0 0
which 0 0
each 0 0
handle 0 0
object 0 0
corresponds 0 0
to 0 0
a 0 0
single 0 0
object 0 0
from 0 0
the 0 0
inheritance 0 1
hierarchy 0 1
Such 0 0
handles 0 1
are 0 0
straightforward 0 0
to 0 0
use 0 0
and 0 0
to 0 0
implement 0 0
and 0 0
tend 0 0
to 0 0
be 0 0
intrinsically 0 0
exception 0 1
safe 0 0
in 0 0
almost 0 0
all 0 0
respects 0 0
The 0 0
one 0 0
exception 0 1
hazard 0 0
in 0 0
such 0 0
a 0 0
class 0 0
is 0 0
typically 0 0
the 0 0
assignment 0 1
operator 0 1
Assignment 0 0
operators 0 0
often 0 0
test 0 0
for 0 0
to 0 0
avoid 0 0
aliasing 0 1
problems 0 1
As 0 0
Herb 0 0
Sutter 0 0
has 0 0
observed 0 0
programs 0 0
that 0 0
need 0 0
such 0 0
tests 0 0
are 0 0
almost 0 0
always 0 0
exception 0 1
unsafe 0 0
By 0 0
rewriting 0 0
the 0 0
assignment 0 1
operator 0 1
we 0 0
ensure 0 0
that 0 0
we 0 0
do 0 0
not 0 0
do 0 0
anything 0 0
irrevocable 0 0
until 0 0
the 0 0
possibility 0 0
of 0 0
throwing 0 0
an 0 0
exception 0 1
has 0 0
passed 0 0
This 0 0
strategy 0 0
ensures 0 0
that 0 0
if 0 0
an 0 0
exception 0 1
occurs 0 0
while 0 0
our 0 0
assignment 0 1
operator 0 1
is 0 0
executing 0 0
we 0 0
do 0 0
not 0 0
corrupt 0 0
the 0 0
rest 0 0
of 0 0
our 0 0
system 0 0
Using 1 0
constructed 1 0
types 1 0
in 1 0
unions 1 0
The 0 0
Standard 0 1
states 0 0
that 0 0
a 0 0
union 0 1
type 0 1
can 0 0
not 0 0
have 0 0
a 0 0

with 0 0
a 0 0
nontrivial 0 0
constructor 0 0
or 0 0
destructor 0 0
While 0 0
at 0 0
first 0 0
this 0 0
seems 0 0
unreasonable 0 0
further 0 0
thought 0 0
makes 0 0
it 0 0
clear 0 0
why 0 0
this 0 0
is 0 0
the 0 0
case 0 0
The 0 0
crux 0 0
of 0 0
the 0 0
problem 0 0
is 0 0
that 0 0
unions 0 0
do 0 0
have 0 0
semantics 0 0
for 0 0
denoting 0 0
when 0 0
a 0 0
member 0 0
is 0 0
the 0 0
current 0 0
member 0 0
of 0 0
the 0 0
union 0 1
Therefore 0 0
the 0 0
compiler 0 0
ca 0 0
know 0 0
when 0 0
it 0 0
appropriate 0 0
to 0 0
call 0 0
constructors 0 1
or 0 0
destructors 0 1
on 0 0
the 0 0
union 0 1
members 0 1
Still 0 0
there 0 0
are 0 0
good 0 0
reasons 0 0
for 0 0
wanting 0 0
to 0 0
use 0 0

in 0 0
a 0 0
union 0 1
For 0 0

you 0 0

the 0 0

Some 0 0

This 0 0

The 0 0

To 0 0

In 0 0

Our 0 0

This 0 0

asks 0 0
why 0 0

more 0 0

to 0 0

to 0 0

the 0 0

rather 0 0
that 0 0

When 0 0
two 0 0

are 0 0
a 0 0

we 0 0
sometimes 0 0
refer 0 0

them 0 0
as 0 0

a 0 0

However 0 0
when 0 0
each 0 0

exists 0 0
in 0 0
the 0 0

which 0 0
the 0 0

I 0 0
explore 0 0
this 0 0
notion 0 0
A 0 0
couple 0 0
has 0 0
what 0 0
we 0 0
call 0 0
the 0 0
problem 0 0
when 0 0
both 0 0
are 0 0
professionals 0 0
who 0 0
are 0 0
qualified 0 0
for 0 0
a 0 0
kind 0 0
of 0 0
position 0 0
that 0 0
is 0 0
relatively 0 0
rare 0 0
and 0 0
who 0 0
are 0 0
very 0 0
selective 0 0
about 0 0
the 0 0
positions 0 0
that 0 0
they 0 0
accept 0 0
For 0 0
example 0 0
there 0 0
are 0 0
relatively 0 0

An 0 0
individual 0 0
considering 0 0

may 0 0
only 0 0
be 0 0
interested 0 0
in 0 0

restricting 0 0
the 0 0
choice 0 0
of 0 0
open 0 0

substantially 0 0
The 0 0
classic 0 0
problem 0 0
arises 0 0
when 0 0
one 0 0
partner 0 0
wants 0 0
to 0 0
accept 0 0
a 0 0
new 0 0
position 0 0
that 0 0
requires 0 0
geographical 0 0
relocation 0 0
Then 0 0
the 0 0
other 0 0
partner 0 0
also 0 0
needs 0 0
to 0 0
find 0 0
a 0 0
new 0 0
position 0 0
Moreover 0 0
it 0 0
can 0 0
be 0 0
very 0 0
difficult 0 0
to 0 0
find 0 0
a 0 0
suitable 0 0
position 0 0
when 0 0
they 0 0
are 0 0
naturally 0 0
scarce 0 0

In 0 0
the 0 0
last 0 0
decade 0 0
we 0 0
have 0 0
both 0 0
monitored 0 0
with 0 0

majors 0 1
at 0 0
our 0 0
respective 0 0
institutions 0 0
With 0 0
each 0 0
entering 0 0
class 0 0
we 0 0
think 0 0
Surely 0 0
now 0 0
is 0 0
the 0 0
time 0 0
when 0 0
the 0 0
numbers 0 0
will 0 0
become 0 0
more 0 0
balanced 0 0
Logic 0 0
tells 0 0
us 0 0
that 0 0
this 0 0
must 0 0
eventually 0 0
happen 0 0
because 0 0
the 0 0
opportunities 0 0
in 0 0
computing 0 0
are 0 0
simply 0 0
too 0 0
attractive 0 0
for 0 0
an 0 0
entire 0 0
segment 0 0
of 0 0
our 0 0
population 0 0
to 0 0
routinely 0 0
pass 0 0
up 0 0
But 0 0
each 0 0
year 0 0
we 0 0
are 0 0
again 0 0
disappointed 0 0
in 0 0
the 0 0
number 0 0

do 0 0
you 0 0
